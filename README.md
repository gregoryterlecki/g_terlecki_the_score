To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup` (and run seeds, next section)
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `npm install` inside the `assets` directory
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Seeding the database:

  * Put the json file to test in priv/repo (make sure it has the name rushing.josn)
  * From the project root, run: mix run priv/repo/seeds.exs
